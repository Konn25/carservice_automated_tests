# Car Service automated tests

I'm always curious how automated tests work. So I decided to learn it as fun. 
Moreover I have a car service app which is not tested in depth especially I test the function manually and write Junit tests.


I used the following tools
  - Robot framework with the following libraries:
    - SeleniumLibrary
    - DateTime
    - DatabaseLibrary
    - Collections
  - RIDE IDE
